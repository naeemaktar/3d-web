            <p>Computer programming is a difficult yet rewarding career.  Programmers use different programming languages in their day-to-day lives; similar to foreign languages they are similar in some ways but different in others.  Three languages commonly used by computer programmers are Visual Basic, C++, and Java (“Major: Computer Programming, General”).  Other languages include SQL, HTML, and .NET (“Interview Questions”).  Programming can even be done as a hobby instead of a career (Reeves and Kent).  People can release their work as open-source software; many of these open-source software such as Apache HTTPD, WordPress, and PHP run millions of websites across the world.  Programming is a “love it or hate it” occupation (Reeves and Kent)</p>
